# Manual Options Trade Journal â€“ Pine Script

This project is a Pine Script implementation for TradingView that allows users to manually log options trades into a live table overlay on a chart.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ“¥ Manual entry of ticker, premium, contracts, strike, expiry, notes
- ðŸ“ˆ Auto-filled live data: timestamp, price, and % change since first log
- ðŸ§¾ Tabular logging for trade journaling and exporting to Google Sheets
- ðŸ”§ Fully customizable and designed to support product experimentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Case

This project was built to support a real-world trading workflow for options traders who:
- Prefer to manually log trades while watching charts
- Want a visual, copyable ledger that evolves in real-time
- Want to later analyze entries/exits in spreadsheets/tabular data or dashboards

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This

- get my first exposure to scripting
- learn more about coding, trading, and using code to trade
- learn about Pine Script 

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. Toggle the `Log Trade` switch inside TradingViewâ€™s indicator settings
2. Fill in your trade metadata (ticker, premium, etc.)
3. The script captures timestamp, price, and calculates % change
4. Each new trade adds a row to the table (up to 50 max)
